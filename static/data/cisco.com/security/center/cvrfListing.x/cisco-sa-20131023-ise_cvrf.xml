    Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability
    Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability 

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is
affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the
other.



Successful exploitation of Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability may allow an authenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.



Successful
exploitation of Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain
sensitive information including administrative credentials.



Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:
