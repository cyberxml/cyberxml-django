Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client installation and replace it with an arbitrary, older version of software that is signed by Cisco. This action could expose the system to subsequent attacks against vulnerabilities found in older versions of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software.

AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to downgrade the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software version to a prior software version. An unauthenticated, remote
attacker could cause systems that have installed affected versions of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility client to download and install an older version of the client software. The affected ActiveX and Java

allow an attacker to deliver prior versions of code signed by Cisco. Older versions of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software could contain vulnerabilities that were not present in the system's initial software version, and expose the system to additional vulnerabilities. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must convince a

</Description></Remediation></Remediations></Vulnerability><Vulnerability Ordinal="4" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1"><Title>Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and Cisco Secure Desktop Hostscan Downloader Software Downgrade Vulnerability</Title><ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCtx74235</ID><Notes><Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="4">Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to downgrade the affected software to a prior software version. This vulnerability is also present in Cisco Secure Desktop. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause systems that have installed affected versions of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility client or Cisco Secure Desktop to download and install an older version of the client software. The affected ActiveX and Java components of these affected software programs do not perform sufficient input validation and, as a result, may allow an attacker to deliver prior versions of code signed by Cisco. Older versions of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software or Cisco Secure Desktop software could contain vulnerabilities that were not present in the system's initial software version, thus exposing the system to additional vulnerabilities. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious web page and execute the vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet. Depending on the user's browser configuration, the process of executing the control or applet may require little or no user interaction because the vulnerable ActiveX controls and Java applets are cryptographically signed by Cisco.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2012-2495</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-109824</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109825</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109826</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-115650</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-115651</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-115652</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-115653</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-115654</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-97081</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98759</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98762</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98763</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98764</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98767</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98768</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98769</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98770</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-98773</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116790</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116791</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116792</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116793</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116794</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116795</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116796</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116797</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116798</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116799</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116800</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>For any of the vulnerabilities in cryptographically signed applets, any system that trusts Cisco's signing certificate chain may be impacted, even if Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client has never been installed on the system.
Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client VPN Downloader Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user's web browser session. If the user possesses elevated privileges, arbitrary code execution could result in complete compromise of an affected system.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client VPN Downloader Software Downgrade Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client installation and replace it with an arbitrary, older version of software that is signed by Cisco. This action could expose the system to subsequent attacks against vulnerabilities found in older versions of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and Cisco Secure Desktop Hostscan Downloader Software Downgrade Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client installation and replace it with an arbitrary, older version of software signed by Cisco. This action could expose the system to subsequent attacks against vulnerabilities found in older versions of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client software.

Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 64-bit Java VPN Downloader Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user's web browser session. If the user possesses elevated privileges, this action could result in complete compromise of an affected system.

Cisco Secure Desktop Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user's web browser session. If the user possesses elevated privileges, this action could result in complete compromise of an affected system.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>4.3</BaseScore><TemporalScore>3.6</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>Blacklists can be enforced manually, based on the instructions provided in the ?Details? section, or by applying updates from Microsoft (2736233["http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2736233"]) or Oracle (Java SE 6 Update 37["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u37-relnotes-1863283.html"] and Java SE 7 Update 9["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u9-relnotes-1863279.html"]) that include ActiveX CLSIDs or Java applet Message Digests.
