The vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented packets. The vulnerability could cause the route processor, which processes the packets, to be unable to transmit packets to the fabric.



Customers that are running version 4.2.1 or later of Cisco IOS XR Software, or that have previously installed the Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMU) for Cisco bug ID CSCtz62593 are not affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of fragmented packets by the following: 

    Cisco CRS 16-Slot Line Card Chassis Route Processor (RP-A) 
    Cisco CRS 16-Slot Line Card Chassis Route Processor B (RP-B) 
    Carrier Routing System (CRS) Performance Route Processor (PRP) 
    Cisco CRS Distributed Route Processor (DRP-B) 

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets to a vulnerable system; this vulnerability cannot be triggered by IP traffic traversing a vulnerable device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the packets originating on the Route Processor CPU to stop transmitting to the fabric, resulting in a DoS condition.



This vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and does not require a TCP three-way handshake.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-5549</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-93249</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100569</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100570</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100571</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100572</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100573</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109761</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109764</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109769</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116014</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116015</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116016</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116017</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-116081</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-195435</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could cause the route processor on an affected device to stop transmitting packets from the route processor CPU to the fabric.
