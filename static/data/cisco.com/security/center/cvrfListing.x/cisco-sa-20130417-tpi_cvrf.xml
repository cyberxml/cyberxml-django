an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the DSP card which will
trigger a reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due
to insufficient validation of a malformed H.264 bit stream that is transported in a Real-Time Transport Protocol
(RTP) packet payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
injecting RTP packets with a malformed H.264 bit stream into an established Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) or H.323 session. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the reload of the affected system.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-1176</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-190447</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190454</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190455</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190456</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190457</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190461</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190463</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190465</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190468</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190469</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190470</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190471</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may cause the reload of the affected system.
