Disable Remote Management




Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN connection. This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.



Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the Web Access screen: Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access. Check the box for Disabled in the Remote Management field.



Disabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities.




Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses



If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of any. By accessing the configuration screen (Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access), an administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with the specified IP addresses can access the device.
