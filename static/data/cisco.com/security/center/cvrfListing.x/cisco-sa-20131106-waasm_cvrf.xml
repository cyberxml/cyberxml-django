The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in the body of an HTTP POST request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP POST request  for content upload that would result in an uncontrolled directory traversal. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the WAAS Mobile server with the privileges of the IIS web server.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-5554</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-194885</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194887</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194889</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194890</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194891</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194892</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194893</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194894</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194895</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194896</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Cisco WAAS Mobile server with the privilege level of the IIS web server.
