The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of security vulnerability information that is related to Cisco products and networks. The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24x7 with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security issues with Cisco products and networks.

Note: Additional research performed by Mr. Eloi Vanderbeken during April 2014 seems to indicate that some products may be affected by another vulnerability, introduced while fixing the original "TCP port 32764 Undocumented Test Interface" vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed the undocumented test interface has been completely removed by the firmware images listed in this advisory and cannot be re-enabled in the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point, Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router, and the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router.



Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain root-level access to the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to a service
listening on TCP port 32764 of the affected device. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by accessing the affected device from the Wireless LAN (WLAN) or the physical LAN interface and issuing arbitrary commands within the underlying
operating system. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to
user credentials for the administrator account of the device.  The
exploit can also allow the attacker to issue arbitrary commands within
the shell as the root level user.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2014-0659</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-197077</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-197078</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-197079</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-197080</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-197081</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities described in this document could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with elevated privileges.
