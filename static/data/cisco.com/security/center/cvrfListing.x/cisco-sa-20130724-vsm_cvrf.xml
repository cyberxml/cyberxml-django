Cisco VSM provides centralized configuration, management, display, and control of video from Cisco and third-party surveillance endpoints. Multiple security vulnerabilities exist in versions of Cisco VSM prior to 7.0.0, which may allow an attacker to gain full administrative privileges on the system.



More information on Cisco VSM can be found at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10818/index.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10818/index.html"]. 



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input processed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a crafted URL. If successful, the attacker could launch directory traversal attacks on the targeted device and access sensitive information from arbitrary files on the system. The attacker could use the information to conduct further attacks.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3429</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-95887</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95889</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95893</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95894</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95896</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95898</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95899</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative control of Cisco VSM.
