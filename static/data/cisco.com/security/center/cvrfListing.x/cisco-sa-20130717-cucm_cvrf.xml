A successful attack could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access, create or modify information in Cisco Unified CM. 



On June 6, 2013, a French security firm, Lexfo, delivered a public presentation on VoIP security that included a demonstration of multiple vulnerabilities used to compromise Cisco Unified CM. During the presentation, the researchers demonstrated a multistaged attack that chained a number of vulnerabilities, which resulted in a complete compromise of the Cisco Unified CM server. The attack chain used the following types of vulnerabilities:

    Blind Structured Query Language (SQL) injection
    Command injection
    Privilege escalation

Cisco PSIRT greatly appreciates the opportunity to work with researchers on security vulnerabilities and welcomes the opportunity to review and assist in product reports.



Cisco has released a Cisco Options Package (COP) file that addresses three of the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory. Cisco is currently investigating the remaining vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) contains  a hard-coded encryption key used for the encryption of sensitive data stored within the database, and securing computer telephony integration (CTI) communications.



The issue is due to the use of a static symmetric encryption key in all Cisco Unified CM versions. An attacker could exploit this issue by using the secret key to decrypt sensitive data including user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive system information such as user credentials gained when using other attacks.</Note></Notes><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-93291</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-96251</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100446</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-101646</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-112613</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189976</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189980</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69406</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69407</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-79284</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-79285</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95121</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95122</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95123</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-95124</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100273</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100274</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100275</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100276</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100277</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100278</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100279</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100280</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100281</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100282</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100283</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-111387</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-111955</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-111956</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-111957</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-111958</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188006</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188007</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189905</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189907</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the blind SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to reconstruct encrypted credentials and insert rows in the Cisco Unified CM database.
