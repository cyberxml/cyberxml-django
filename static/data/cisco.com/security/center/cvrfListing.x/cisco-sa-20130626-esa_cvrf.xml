     Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability 
    IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability 

    

Successful
exploitation of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability could allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
operating system with elevated privileges. 

Successful
exploitation of either of the two denial of service vulnerabilities may
cause several critical processes to become unresponsive and make the
affected system unstable.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user supplied input that is subsequently utilized to perform an action that leverages the underlying command-line interface of the device. An authenticated but unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the affected system, or by convincing a valid user to click on a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with sufficient knowledge to take complete control of the affected device.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3384</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-189793</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189795</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189797</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189952</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189953</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189954</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189955</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189956</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189799</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189801</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189803</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189805</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189960</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189961</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189962</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189963</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189964</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189965</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189966</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189967</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189968</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190773</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190774</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189811</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189813</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189815</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189957</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189958</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-189959</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-190772</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful

Administrators can use the interfaceconifg command to disable appliance management via the GUI. Alternatively, this can be done via the
GUI by editing the management interface properties under Network-&gt;IP
interfaces-&gt; Edit and then selecting Disable Appliance Management.



Note: Administrators can manage the affected system via SSH and command-line interface while GUI access is
disabled. However, not all commands and features may be available via command-line interface.



Administrators can also limit the attack surface by restricting IP addresses that can access the management interface. This can be
done using the adminaccessconfig command and selecting IPACCESS from the menu.



Administrator should also implement Cross-Site Request Forgery
protection if available on their platform and software release. This
will help limit the attack surface of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability, although it will not completely eliminate it.



The IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the end-user access to the ISQ service. Administrators can disable this access using the interfaceconfig command. Alternatively, this can be done via the
GUI by editing the settings for Spam Quarantine under Monitor-&gt;Quarantines-&gt; Edit and then unchecking the option "Enable End-User Quarantine Access".



Note: Users will be unable to manage their safe list and block list while end-user access is disabled.

exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker prevent management access via the GUI and cause other critical process to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.
