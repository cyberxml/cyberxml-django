The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed H.323 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted H.323 packet through the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to reload the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, resulting in denial of service (DoS) condition.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2012-5419</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-185563</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185564</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of the affected device.

Administrators can disable H.323 inspection for H.225 messages by issuing the no inspect h323 h225 command in class configuration submode in the policy map configuration. H.323 inspection for H.225 messages should be disabled for the workaround to be effective. 



The following example shows how to disable H.323 inspection from the default policy-map:





ASA1000v(config)# policy-map global_policy
ASA1000v(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
ASA1000v(config-pmap-c)# no inspect h323 h225


If H.323 inspection for H.225 messages is required, there are no workarounds.</Description></Remediation></Remediations></Vulnerability></cvrfdoc>
